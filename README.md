# Batteries
A mod that adds battery items to the game which can be found on any moon. Batteries can be used on any battery powered item to recharge it at the cost of consuming the battery. If you wish, you can also sell batteries as scrap.

Certain aspects of the mod can be modified using the configuration file such as how much batteries recharge items or how much batteries are worth.

To install the mod manually (outside Thunderstore) put the "batteries" and "Batteries.dll" file inside a folder called Batteries (or whatever you want to name it) under the BepInEx/plugins directory.

A big thanks to TrevTastic for providing the model and texture.
