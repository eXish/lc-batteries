# Batteries
A mod that adds battery items to the game that can be found on any moon. Batteries can be used on any battery powered item to recharge it at the cost of consuming the battery. Simply hold the item you wish to recharge in your hand and press the use battery keybind (C). If you wish, you can also sell batteries as scrap.

Certain aspects of the mod can be modified using the configuration file such as how much batteries recharge items or how much batteries are worth. By default batteries are fairly common and will only recharge items by 25%.

To install the mod manually (outside Thunderstore) put the "batteries" and "Batteries.dll" file inside a folder called Batteries (or whatever you want to name it) under the BepInEx/plugins directory.

A big thanks to TrevTastic for providing the model and texture.
